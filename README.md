# Truss Technical Interview

This project is my work sample being submitted to Trussworks for consideration.

## Steps to run

The `sample.csv` and `sample-with-broken-utf8.csv` files are stored in the repo and hardcoded as the default arguments to be passed in to the CLI.

1. clone this repository
2. ensure `docker` && `docker-compose` are installed
3. `docker-compose up`

The transformed csv will be output to `output.csv`.
